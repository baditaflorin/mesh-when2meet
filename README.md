## What it is

Peer-to-peer browser app, no backend of its own beyond the self-hosted WebRTC stack listed below. Built on `@baditaflorin/mesh-common`, hosted on GitHub Pages from `docs/`.

## Quickstart (local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baditaflorin/mesh-common
git clone https://github.com/baditaflorin/mesh-when2meet
cd mesh-when2meet
npm install
npm run dev
```

`mesh-common` must sit as a **sibling** directory because `package.json` references it via `file:../mesh-common`.

## Self-hosted infrastructure

| Repo                                              | Endpoint                               | Purpose                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/signaling-server  | `wss://turn.0docker.com/ws`            | y-webrtc signaling fan-out  |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/turn-token-server | `https://turn.0docker.com/credentials` | HMAC TURN creds, 1-hour TTL |
| https://github.com/baditaflorin/coturn-hetzner    | `turn:turn.0docker.com:3479`           | TURN relay                  |

## Settings overrides (localStorage keys)

The settings drawer lets the user override signaling and TURN endpoints. Keys:

- `mesh-when2meet:signalingUrl`
- `mesh-when2meet:turnTokenUrl`
- `mesh-when2meet:iceServers`
- `mesh-when2meet:room`

If endpoints are blank or unreachable, the app falls back to STUN-only.

## Build & deploy

GitHub Pages serves the committed `docs/` directory on the `main` branch. There is **no GitHub Actions build workflow**; the Husky pre-commit + pre-push hooks gate formatting / typecheck / smoke build locally.

```bash
npm run smoke   # build + sanity-check docs/
```

## Privacy

See `docs/privacy.md` for the threat model — what other peers in the mesh see, what the self-hosted infra sees, what stays local.

## License

MIT — see `LICENSE`.
